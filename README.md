# Full Stack Open 2022
This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

the content is the same as in the Full stack course held at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in Spring 2020.
